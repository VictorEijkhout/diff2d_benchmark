Each poster will have its own stand.  The stands are fairly large.
They are configured in a landscape orientation and have a usable width
of 93" and usable height of 45" (2.362m x 1.143m).  You can use as
much or as little of the space on your stand as you see fit.  Posters
will be attached to the stands by onsite staff prior to registration
Sunday night, September 15.

You will need to prepare the posters yourselves and submit them prior
to the start of the conference.  Posters should be sent to the
following address:

Guardian Storage Aurora
Attention: Standard C++ Foundation (Poster Program)
3633 N Walden Circle
Aurora, CO 80011

Phone: (720) 414-5393

You should ship with tracking/notification of receipt, and you will
need to be sure to ship in plenty of time so that we receive your
poster before September 15, and also so that you can be assured they
have arrived.

Again, we will look forward to seeing you at the conference, and
thanks very much for your participation in the poster program.

Best,
Daniel Hanson
